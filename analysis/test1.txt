```

#### Explanation of the JCL Script

1. **JOB Statement**
   - `/*` defines a comment line that provides information about this scriptâ€™s purpose.
   - `//STEP1` is the first job step to compile the CALCULATE-AREA COBOL program using the Enterprise COBOL compiler.

2. **Compile Step**
   - `EXEC PGM=IGYCRCTL`: Executes the COBOL compiler program.
   - `SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*`: Directs the compiler output to the system printer.
   - `SYSIN DD *`: In-stream data: the source code of the COBOL program.

3. **Link-Edit Step (LKED)**
   - `EXEC PGM=HEWL`: Executes the linkage editor to create an executable module.
   - `SYSLMOD` points to the load library where the executable will be stored.
   - `SYSPRINT` to show the link-edit results.

4. **Execution Step (GO)**
   - `EXEC PGM=CALCAREO`: Executes the compiled COBOL program.
   - `STEPLIB` to load the library containing the executable code.
   - `SYSPRINT` and `SYSOUT` direct program messages and output to system printers or consoles.
   - `SYSIN DUMMY` since this program does not read input from a file.

#### Data Flow and Integration Points

- **Data Flow**: Data flows through variable assignments within the COBOL program, where LENGTH is set to 10, WIDTH to 5, and AREA is computed as the product of LENGTH and WIDTH.

- **Integration Points**: The key integration points in the mainframe environment include:
  - The COBOL compiler (IGYCRCTL) and linkage editor (HEWL), which process the COBOL source code.
  - Load libraries where compiled modules are stored and executed.
  - System output (SYSPRINT, SYSOUT), through which the results and messages of both compiler and program execution are channeled.

In summary, this JCL script effectively compiles, link-edits, and executes the COBOL program that calculates and displays the area of a rectangle. The COBOL program works with predefined variables and directs output to standard devices defined in the JCL.

## Task: Analyze the PL/I code components and their interaction with COBOL programs.
    Identify shared data structures and inter-program communication.


# Agent: PL/I Code Analyst
## Final Answer:
### Detailed Report on PL/I Code Structure and COBOL Integration

#### Analysis of PL/I Code Components and COBOL Interaction

**PL/I Code Structure:**
PL/I (Programming Language One) is a robust language often used in mainframe environments for its rich feature set that includes structured programming, exception handling, and built-in functions for complex data manipulation. It's essential to analyze how this PL/I code interacts with COBOL programs and identify the shared data structures and communication methods.

**Common Components in PL/I Code:**
1. **Declarations:** PL/I uses `DECLARE` statements to define variables and data structures, which include scalars, arrays, structures, and pointers.
2. **Procedures:** Managed by `PROCEDURE` definitions that can contain local variables, operations, logic, and calls to other procedures or functions.
3. **Input/Output:** Managed with `READ`, `WRITE`, `PRINT`, and data files that might be synchronized with COBOL programs through shared datasets.
4. **Control Statements:** These include `IF`, `THEN`, `ELSE`, `DO`, `SELECT`, which control the logical flow.

**Interaction with COBOL:**
PL/I code and COBOL programs often interact in mainframe systems, typically through shared datasets, procedure calls, or common APIs provided by external libraries.

**Shared Data Structures:**
- **Files and Datasets:** Both PL/I and COBOL often access the same flat files, VSAM datasets, or databases (e.g., DB2). This can involve reading from and writing to shared data sources.
- **Common Copybooks/Includes:** Reusable data definitions can be shared using COPYbooks in COBOL or %INCLUDE files in PL/I. These assure that both codebases have a consistent view of the data layout.
- **Linkage Sections and PL/I Structures:** COBOL's Linkage Section and PL/I's DECLARE structures must be aligned to ensure proper data exchange during inter-language calls or dataset manipulations.

**Inter-Program Communication:**
1. **Calling Conventions:**
   - PL/I can call COBOL programs and vice versa.

```pli
// PL/I calling COBOL
DCL CALL_COBOL_PROGRAM ENTRY (FIXED BIN(31), CHAR(20)) OPTIONS(RETCODE);
CALL CALL_COBOL_PROGRAM (return_code, section_name);
```

```cobol
* COBOL Program
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. 'CALL_COBOL_PROGRAM'.

WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
77 SECTION-NAME    PIC X(20).
LINKAGE SECTION.
01 RETURN-CODE     PIC 9(31).
01 SECTION-NAME    PIC X(20).

PROCEDURE DIVISION USING RETURN-CODE, SECTION-NAME.
* COBOL Logic Here
EXIT PROGRAM.
```

2. **Data Sharing via Datasets:**
   - Both languages can write to and read from datasets. Proper synchronization must be ensured.

```pli
// PL/I Sample Write
DCL FILE1 FILE RECORD INPUT;
OPEN FILE1;
READ FILE1 INTO (myData);
CLOSE FILE1;
```

```cobol
* COBOL Sample Read
DATA DIVISION.
FILE SECTION.
FD  FILE1
    LABEL RECORDS ARE STANDARD
    BLOCK CONTAINS 0 RECORDS
    RECORDING MODE F
    DATA RECORD IS myData.
01  myData    PIC X(100).

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
OPEN INPUT FILE1.
READ FILE1 INTO myData
AT END
    DISPLAY 'End of File'
END-READ.
CLOSE FILE1.
```

**Example Scenario - Integration Overview:**

1. **JCL Job Script:**
   - Executes a PL/I program that prepares data.
   - Follows up with a COBOL program to process the data.

```jcl
//PLIJOB  JOB (1234),'PL/I and COBOL Integration',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=X
//* Compile and Link the PL/I Program
//PLI1   EXEC PGM=PL/I_COMPILER
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN    DD  *

/*
//LKED    EXEC PGM=HEWL
//SYSLMOD  DD  DSN=PLI.LOADLIB(PLIPGM),DISP=SHR
//SYSUT1   DD  UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))
//SYSIN    DD  *
  INCLUDE ObjectModule
  NAME PLIPGM(R)
/*
//Run the PL/I Program
//RUNPLI  EXEC PGM=PLIPGM

//SYSIN    DD  *
  INCLUDE ObjectModule
  NAME COBOLPGM(R)
/*
//Run the COBOL Program

//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSOUT  DD DUMMY
//SYSIN   DD *
  Param1
  Param2
 /
```

---

In summary, PL/I and COBOL integration in mainframe environments requires careful handling of data structures, inter-program communication, and JCL job orchestration. While both languages have their unique syntax and operational behavior, understanding their overlapping areas and shared resources is crucial for seamless integration. Properly aligning data definitions, ensuring synchronized dataset access, and leveraging the JCL scripts effectively can support complex workflows combining PL/I and COBOL efficiencies.

# Agent: COBOL Code Analyst
## Task: Analyze the provided COBOL code and determine its complexity. Provide metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, code readability, and maintainability. Based on this analysis, suggest any refactoring priorities.


# Agent: COBOL Code Analyst
## Final Answer:
Based on the provided COBOL code, here is a comprehensive analysis of its complexity along with recommendations for improvement:

### 1. Cyclomatic Complexity:
Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. The formula to compute cyclomatic complexity is M = E - N + 2P (where E is the number of edges, N is the number of nodes, and P is the number of connected components).

For the given code:

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. CALCULATE-AREA.

DATA DIVISION.
    WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
        01 LENGTH PIC 9(3).
        01 WIDTH PIC 9(3).
        01 AREA PIC 9(5).

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    MOVE 10 TO LENGTH.
    MOVE 5 TO WIDTH.
    COMPUTE AREA = LENGTH * WIDTH.
    DISPLAY "The area of the rectangle is: " AREA.
    STOP RUN.
```

- Number of edges (E): 5 (MOVE, MOVE, COMPUTE, DISPLAY, STOP)
- Number of nodes (N): 5
- Number of connected components (P): 1

Cyclomatic complexity M = E - N + 2P = 5 - 5 + 2*1 = 2.

Cyclomatic complexity = 2, which indicates low complexity, implying that the code is straightforward and easy to comprehend.

### 2. Lines of Code (LOC):
The total count of lines in the provided program:
- Total Lines: 16 (including empty lines and section headers).

### 3. Code Readability:
The code is simple and easy to read. It follows standard COBOL sections and formatting, with clear and concise variable names (LENGTH, WIDTH, AREA). The logic is straightforward and self-explanatory.

### 4. Maintainability:
The maintainability of the code can be judged to be high given its low cyclomatic complexity and clear structure. It uses COBOL constructs correctly and efficiently for such a simple calculation.

### Recommendations for Refactoring:
Given that the code is very simple and has low cyclomatic complexity, there isn't much need for extensive refactoring. However, here are a few suggestions for slight improvements:

1. **Use Constants for Hardcoded Values:**
   - Instead of hardcoding values directly into the code, we could define constants for LENGTH and WIDTH in the WORKING-STORAGE section to make the code more flexible and maintainable.

```cobol
DATA DIVISION.
    WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
        01 LENGTH PIC 9(3) VALUE 10.
        01 WIDTH PIC 9(3) VALUE 5.
        01 AREA PIC 9(5).
```

2. **Use Inline Comments:**
   - Adding comments to describe each step, although obvious in this simple example, is a good practice especially as complexity increases.

3. **Modularize the Code:**
   - Encapsulate the logic in a separate paragraph or section for better modularity, even though it may seem unnecessary here, it is a good practice for scaling up.

```cobol
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    PERFORM CALCULATE-AREA-PARA.
    DISPLAY "The area of the rectangle is: " AREA.
    STOP RUN.

CALCULATE-AREA-PARA.
    MOVE LENGTH TO LENGTH.
    MOVE WIDTH TO WIDTH.
    COMPUTE AREA = LENGTH * WIDTH.
```

### Conclusion:
The given COBOL code for calculating the area of a rectangle is quite simple with a cyclomatic complexity of 2. It is straightforward, easy to read, and maintainable. Minor refactoring suggestions include using constants for hardcoded values and adding comments to improve readability and flexibility. Overall, the code is in good shape with a strong structure and clarity.

        MOVE WIDTH TO WIDTH.
        COMPUTE AREA = LENGTH * WIDTH.
    ```

#### Integration Context with PL/I and JCL

**PL/I Code Structure:**

PL/I has robust features supporting structured programming, data manipulation, and integration with COBOL through shared datasets and procedure calls. Common components include DECLARE statements, procedure definitions, robust control statements (`IF`, `THEN`, `ELSE`, `DO`, `SELECT`), and I/O operations.

**Interactions and Data Sharing:**

1. **Shared Data Structures:**
    - **Files and Datasets:** Both languages access flat files, VSAM datasets, or databases (e.g., DB2).
    - **Copybooks/Includes:** Shared definitions using COPYbooks in COBOL and %INCLUDE in PL/I.
    - **Linkage Sections:** Alignment between COBOLâ€™s Linkage Section and PL/Iâ€™s DECLARE structures for data exchange.

2. **Inter-Program Communication:**
   - PL/I can call COBOL programs and vice versa with correct linkage and data structures.

   Example:
   ```pli
   // PL/I calling COBOL
   DCL CALL_COBOL_PROGRAM ENTRY (FIXED BIN(31), CHAR(20)) OPTIONS(RETCODE);
   CALL CALL_COBOL_PROGRAM (return_code, section_name);
   ```

   ```cobol
   * COBOL Program
   IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
   PROGRAM-ID. 'CALL_COBOL_PROGRAM'.

   WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
   77 SECTION-NAME    PIC X(20).
   LINKAGE SECTION.
   01 RETURN-CODE     PIC 9(31).
   01 SECTION-NAME    PIC X(20).

   PROCEDURE DIVISION USING RETURN-CODE, SECTION-NAME.
   * COBOL Logic Here
   EXIT PROGRAM.
   ```

**Example Scenario - Integration Overview:**

**JCL Job Script:**
   - Manages the execution sequence, compiling, and linking of both PL/I and COBOL programs.

   Example:
   ```jcl
   //PLIJOB  JOB (1234),'PL/I and COBOL Integration',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=X
   //* Compile and Link the PL/I Program
   //PLI1   EXEC PGM=PL/I_COMPILER

### Comprehensive Complexity Assessment Report for the Legacy Codebase

#### Overview

This report provides a detailed complexity assessment of the legacy codebase, focusing on the COBOL code provided and its integration with PL/I and JCL scripts. The report includes metrics and analysis for the COBOL code, interactions with PL/I programs, and recommendations for improving maintainability and performance.

#### COBOL Code Complexity Analysis

**Code:**

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. CALCULATE-AREA.

DATA DIVISION.
    WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
        01 LENGTH PIC 9(3).
        01 WIDTH PIC 9(3).
        01 AREA PIC 9(5).

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    MOVE 10 TO LENGTH.
    MOVE 5 TO WIDTH.
    COMPUTE AREA = LENGTH * WIDTH.
    DISPLAY "The area of the rectangle is: " AREA.
    STOP RUN.
```

**Metrics:**

1. **Cyclomatic Complexity:**
    - Cyclomatic Complexity: `2` (Indicating low complexity and straightforwardness)

2. **Lines of Code (LOC):**
    - Total Lines: `16` (Including empty lines and section headers)

3. **Code Readability:**
    - The structure is standard and clear.
    - Logical steps (MOVE, COMPUTE, DISPLAY) are straightforward.
    - Variable names (LENGTH, WIDTH, AREA) offer clarity.

4. **Maintainability:**
    - High maintainability due to low complexity and simple structure.
    - COBOL constructs are used correctly and effectively.

**Recommendations for Refactoring:**

1. **Use Constants for Hardcoded Values:**
    - Define constants in the WORKING-STORAGE section for LENGTH and WIDTH to improve flexibility and maintainability.

    ```cobol
    DATA DIVISION.
        WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
            01 LENGTH PIC 9(3) VALUE 10.
            01 WIDTH PIC 9(3) VALUE 5.
            01 AREA PIC 9(5).
    ```

2. **Use Inline Comments:**
    - Comments, while redundant for the current simplicity, should describe each step for better understandability as complexity increases.

3. **Modularize the Code:**
    - Encapsulate logic in separate paragraphs or sections for better modularity.

    ```cobol
    PROCEDURE DIVISION.
        PERFORM CALCULATE-AREA-PARA.
        DISPLAY "The area of the rectangle is: " AREA.
        STOP RUN.

    CALCULATE-AREA-PARA.
        MOVE LENGTH TO LENGTH.
        MOVE WIDTH TO WIDTH.
        COMPUTE AREA = LENGTH * WIDTH.
    ```

#### Integration Context with PL/I and JCL

**PL/I Code Structure:**

PL/I has robust features supporting structured programming, data manipulation, and integration with COBOL through shared datasets and procedure calls. Common components include DECLARE statements, procedure definitions, robust control statements (`IF`, `THEN`, `ELSE`, `DO`, `SELECT`), and I/O operations.

**Interactions and Data Sharing:**

1. **Shared Data Structures:**
    - **Files and Datasets:** Both languages access flat files, VSAM datasets, or databases (e.g., DB2).
    - **Copybooks/Includes:** Shared definitions using COPYbooks in COBOL and %INCLUDE in PL/I.
    - **Linkage Sections:** Alignment between COBOLâ€™s Linkage Section and PL/Iâ€™s DECLARE structures for data exchange.

2. **Inter-Program Communication:**
   - PL/I can call COBOL programs and vice versa with correct linkage and data structures.

   Example:
   ```pli
   // PL/I calling COBOL
   DCL CALL_COBOL_PROGRAM ENTRY (FIXED BIN(31), CHAR(20)) OPTIONS(RETCODE);
   CALL CALL_COBOL_PROGRAM (return_code, section_name);
   ```

   ```cobol
   * COBOL Program
   IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
   PROGRAM-ID. 'CALL_COBOL_PROGRAM'.

   WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
   77 SECTION-NAME    PIC X(20).
   LINKAGE SECTION.
   01 RETURN-CODE     PIC 9(31).
   01 SECTION-NAME    PIC X(20).

   PROCEDURE DIVISION USING RETURN-CODE, SECTION-NAME.
   * COBOL Logic Here
   EXIT PROGRAM.
   ```

**Example Scenario - Integration Overview:**

**JCL Job Script:**
   - Manages the execution sequence, compiling, and linking of both PL/I and COBOL programs.

   Example:
   ```jcl
   //PLIJOB  JOB (1234),'PL/I and COBOL Integration',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=X
   //* Compile and Link the PL/I Program
   //PLI1   EXEC PGM=PL/I_COMPILER
   //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
   //SYSIN    DD  *
   ... PL/I Source Code ...
   /*
   //LKED    EXEC PGM=HEWL
   //SYSLMOD  DD  DSN=PLI.LOADLIB(PLIPGM),DISP=SHR
   //SYSUT1   DD  UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))
   //SYSIN    DD  *
   INCLUDE ObjectModule
   NAME PLIPGM(R)
   /*
   //Run the PL/I Program
   //RUNPLI  EXEC PGM=PLIPGM
   //STEPLIB DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=PLI.LOADLIB
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
   //SYSOUT  DD DUMMY
   //SYSIN   DD *
   Param1
   Param2
   /
   //* Compile and Link the COBOL Program
   //COBSTEP EXEC PGM=IGYCRCTL
   //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
   //SYSIN    DD  *
   ... COBOL Source Code ...
   /*
   //LKED    EXEC PGM=HEWL
   //SYSLMOD  DD  DSN=COBOL.LOADLIB(COBOLPGM),DISP=SHR
   //SYSUT1   DD  UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))
   //SYSIN    DD  *
   INCLUDE ObjectModule
   NAME COBOLPGM(R)
   /*
   //Run the COBOL Program
   //RUNCOB EXEC PGM=COBOLPGM
   //STEPLIB DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=COBOL.LOADLIB
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
   //SYSOUT  DD DUMMY
   //SYSIN   DD *
   Param1
   Param2
   /
   ```
