### Project Structure Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for structuring and writing code for Python microservices with the following directories: `Controller` and `Services`.

---

### General Coding Guidelines

- **Naming Convention**: Use `snake_case` for naming variables, functions, and methods.
- **Comments**: Use both single-line comments and multi-line comments (docstrings) to describe your code. Docstrings should be used to describe functions, methods, and classes, including their parameters and return values.

---

### Directory: Controller

**Purpose**: This directory contains all the routes of your microservice.

#### Example Code for a Route

```python
"""
Defines the endpoint for generating documentation from the provided code.

Route: /generate_documentation
Method: POST

Parameters:
    - code (str): The source code for which the documentation is to be generated.

Returns:
    - JSON response containing the generated documentation or an error message if the code is not provided.
"""
@app.route('/generate_documentation', methods=['POST'])
def generate_documentation_endpoint():
    code = request.json.get('code')
    if not code:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Nessun codice fornito'}), 400

    documentation = generate_documentation(code)
    return jsonify({'documentation': documentation})
```

---

### Directory: Services

**Purpose**: This directory contains all the services that are called by the Controller.

#### Example Code for a Service

```python
"""
Generates documentation for the provided source code.

Parameters:
    - code (str): The source code for which the documentation is to be generated.

Returns:
    - str: The generated documentation as a string.
"""
def generate_documentation(code):
    # Logic to generate documentation
    documentation = f"Documentation for the code:\n{code}"  # Simple example
    return documentation
```

### Guidelines for Writing Code

1. **Naming Convention: snake_case**

    - Use `snake_case` for naming variables, functions, and methods.
    - Example:
      ```python
      def generate_documentation(code):
          pass
      ```

2. **Commenting Style**

    - Use single-line comments for brief explanations within the code.
      ```python
      # This is a single-line comment
      ```
    - Use multi-line comments (docstrings) for describing functions, methods, classes, and modules.
      ```python
      """
      This is a multi-line comment or docstring.
      It provides detailed information about the function, method, or class.
      """
      ```

    - **Docstring Format**: Include a description of the function, its parameters, and its return values.
      ```python
      """
      Brief description of the function.

      Parameters:
          param1 (type): Description of param1.
          param2 (type): Description of param2.

      Returns:
          return_type: Description of the return value.
      """
      ```

By following these guidelines, we ensure consistency and readability across the project, making it easier for team members to collaborate and maintain the codebase.
